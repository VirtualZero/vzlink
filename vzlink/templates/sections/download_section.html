                                    Download the VZLink virtual machine to get started using the API
                                    on the intranet of your own home or office. The VM is preconfigured and secured so
                                    installation is simply a matter of downloading the VM and importing it
                                    into your hypervisor. Running the API with the VM provides an opportunity
                                    to test or use the API in a secure, sandboxed setting.

                                        The Debian 9.7 minimal server VM is configured to use 1GB of RAM and 4GB of hard drive
                                        space. The API is running as a systemd service and is enabled on system startup. The VM is
                                        configured to install security updates automatically, but it will need to be restarted
                                        from time to time to apply them. The UFW firewall is enabled and configured and a
                                        self-signed SSL certificate is also installed. Browser's don't like self-signed certificates,
                                        but you can ignore any warnings. All communications with the server will be encrypted.
