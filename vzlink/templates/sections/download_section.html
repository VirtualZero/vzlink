                            Download the datetime-utils-api virtual machine to get started using the API
                            on the intranet of your own home or office. The vm is preconfigured and secured so
                            installation is simply a matter of downloading the VM and importing it
                            into your hypervisor. Running the API with the VM provides an opportunity
                            to test or use the API in a secure, sandboxed setting.
                            </p>

                                The Debian 9.7 minimal server vm is configured to use 1GB of RAM and 6GB of hard drive
                                space. The API is running as a systemd service and is enabled on system startup. The vm is
                                configured to install security updates automatically, but it will need to be restarted
                                from time to time to apply them. The UFW firewall is enabled and configured and a
                                self-signed SSL certificate is also installed. Browser's don't like self-signed certificates,
                                but you can ignore any warnings. All communications with the server will be encrypted.

                                It is important to change the default passwords in the system. The default passwords are
                                included with the download in readme.txt. readme.txt also includes instructions on how to change
                                the passwords and start using the API.
